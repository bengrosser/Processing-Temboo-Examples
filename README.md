Processing-Temboo-Examples
==========================

This respository contains a number of example programs written in Processing that illustrate various ways of using the [Temboo](http://temboo.com) library. Temboo provides libraries for Processing (and many other languages) that abstracts and simplifies the task of interacting with the APIs of sites like Facebook and Twitter. I wrote these examples for a course I taught on Computational Art at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Note that all examples will require you to obtain your own Temboo credentials and API keys from the online API in question. The Temboo website has information on how to obtain these if you aren't already familiar with it.


Twitter
------

- [Basic Twitter Search](https://github.com/bengrosser/Processing-Temboo-Examples/blob/master/Twitter_Search_Basic.pde) -- demonstrates a simple search for a specific string
- [Twitter Search New](https://github.com/bengrosser/Processing-Temboo-Examples/blob/master/Twitter_Search_New.pde) -- search Twitter for specific string, but only return results *new* since last search
- [Twitter Search ArrayList](https://github.com/bengrosser/Processing-Temboo-Examples/blob/master/Twitter_Search_ArrayList.pde) -- returns Twitter search results as an ArrayList

Facebook
--------

- [Facebook Friend Status Like](https://github.com/bengrosser/Processing-Temboo-Examples/blob/master/Facebook_Friend_Status_Like.pde) -- Get Friend/Status/Likes from Facebook

XML
---

- [NYT Gender Comparison](https://github.com/bengrosser/Processing-Temboo-Examples/blob/master/Get_XML_NYT_Gender_Comparison.pde) -- Search through a website's RSS using the Temboo to get and parse the XML


HTML
----

- [HTML Search Term Comparison](https://github.com/bengrosser/Processing-Temboo-Examples/blob/master/Get_HTML_Search_Comparison.pde) -- Use Temboo's GET function to grab HTML from two different pages, search that HTML for specific terms, and print out the term counts
